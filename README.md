# Maven-Traders-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-MS-Excel
The Maven Traders Sales Data Analysis Project was developed in Microsoft Excel using a dataset obtained from the 🌐 internet. The main objective of this project was to perform a complete sales and profitability analysis for Maven Traders and present it through an 📊 interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

The dataset — consisting of files such as 🗓️ calendar.csv, 📘 data_dictionary.csv, 📦 inventory.csv, 🧸 products.csv, 🏬 stores.csv, and 💹 sales.csv — was first 🧹 cleaned, 🧩 formatted, and 🗂️ structured properly to ensure accuracy in calculations.

Using Excel tools such as 📈 PivotTables, 📊 PivotCharts, 🎛️ Slicers, and ⚙️ Measures (DAX formulas), multiple insights were derived. The dashboard includes nine key visuals covering different aspects such as:
📅 Revenue by Days, 🗓️ Revenue by Month, 📍 Store Location, 🏆 Top 5 Stores, 🎯 Top 5 Products, and 💼 Profit by Category.

Additionally, two slicers — By Days and By Months — were added to make the dashboard 🔁 dynamic, allowing users to filter data and view trends interactively.

The dashboard also highlights four essential KPIs:
💵 Total Sales | ⚙️ COGS | 📊 Total Profit | 📈 Profit Margin (%) — each designed in a clean and modern style to enhance readability.

Through this project, meaningful insights such as ⭐ top-performing stores, 🧸 high-revenue products, and 📆 profit trends across different time periods were discovered. Overall, this project demonstrates how Excel can be effectively used for 💼 business data analysis, 🎨 visual storytelling, and 🧠 decision-making support by transforming raw sales data into actionable insights.
